This smell arises when a method contains a long number of argument (five or more), which can indicate that a new object should be created to wrap the numerous parameters. The defined number of arguments can be edited in RBExcessiveArgumentsRule>>argumentsCount.

If the arguments are used in multiple methods this is a clear indication for the creation of an object representing the context in which the computation should occur. 
	
The defined number of arguments can be edited in #argumentsCount.
