Sometimes instance variables are used instead of method arguments or temporaries. You can check if an instance variable's value is always valid during the complete lifetime of an object. In addition, looking at methods used together by a group of methods may be an indication that a new object should be created. Large classes often exhibit a large number of instance variables. Some people also confuse classes and namespaces. 

The defined number of instance variables can be edited in #variablesCount.
