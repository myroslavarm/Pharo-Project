This smell arises when a method return a boolean value (true or false) and return some other value such as (nil or self). If the method is suppose to return a boolean, then this signifies that there is one path through the method that might return a non-boolean. If the method doesn''t need to return a boolean, it should be probably rewriten to return some non-boolean value since other programmers reading the method might assume that it returns a boolean.
