Check for a =, ==, ~=, or ~~ message being sent to true/false or with true/false as the argument. Many times these can be eliminated since their receivers are already booleans. For example, "anObject isFoo == false" could be replaced with "anObject isFoo not" if isFoo always returns a boolean. Sometimes variables might refer to true, false, and something else, but this is considered bad style since the variable has multiple types.
