# Pharo-Project
This is the main repository used while working on my GSoC project - Advancing in Pharo Code Quality support.
This repository contains updated rules. The types of the rules I have been working on converting are RBBlockLintRule, RBParseTreeRule, and RBTransformationRule. During GSoC I converted more than 100 rules.

Two other repositories I made commits into as part of GSoC are:
1. https://github.com/myroslavarm/Renraku - this is my contribution to the Renraku tool which has already been integrated in Pharo 7. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@myroslavarm/renraku-release-1-0-already-integrated-457ca9bd7916)
2. https://github.com/myroslavarm/MatchRewriteTool
